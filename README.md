# MATLAB-voice-signal-splicing-and-noise-reduction
Use MATLAB to splice voice signal and reduce noise

MATLAB programming is used to complete the splicing of speech fragments into a whole section of speech. Specifically, the project gave a lot of voice files (fragments) that were contaminated by various kinds of pollution. I designed the algorithm and used MATLAB programming to make the final program not only correctly splicing to restore the original signal, but also to make the voice affected by pollution as little as possible and the processed signal as realistic as possible. The project requires both noise reduction and splicing.
